Second, the polygon is made Y-monotone, meaning traveling counter-clockwise on the left side and clockwise on the right sides never has an edge that is directed up. If an edge is directed up, it needs to be sliced based on the stack of corner vertices (different slice behavior depending on normal, merge, split, start, and end vertices). Finally, the polygon is in Y-monotone chunks that are triangulated, with checks to preserve the manifold shape (again, based on vertex types). Now we have a fully triangulated DCEL.

I am certain I saved many hours of drawing polygons out by hand by writing this tool, and I was the only student who had ever done this for the assignment.

Binary trees can have multiple entry points to the same sub-trees and get 'pruned' which reuses existing sub-trees from the previous binary tree, as long as the same sub-tree structure is still in the buffer. This persistence and reuse of sub-trees results in a smaller data structure of approximately n log n in size.
